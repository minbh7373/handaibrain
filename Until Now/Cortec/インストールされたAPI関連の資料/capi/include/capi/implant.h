* the hardware abstraction layer. Stimulation is triggered as an stimulation command, which is checked for compliance
* with the corresponding implant stimulation constraints and processed if it satisfies the requirements.
*
* All module functions return STATUS_RUNTIME_ERROR if the execution of the commands fails (e.g. missing connection).
